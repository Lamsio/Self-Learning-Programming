#### Principles of Public-Key Cryptosystem
```text
Symmetric algorithms:
used same secret key for encryption and decryption

Asymmetric algorithms:
one key for encryption, another key for decryption, they are not same.


Public keys are often used to decrypt information. Available to anyone.

Private key is kept by owner

#### Attack for Public-Key
```text
Brute Force Attacks
1. use large key to avoid.
2. Public-key algorithms less efficient with larger keys
3. Public-key algorithms is used to
