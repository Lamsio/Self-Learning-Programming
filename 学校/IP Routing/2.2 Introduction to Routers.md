2. Execute Bootstrap Loader
3. Locate the IOS

5. Locate the configuration file
6. Execute the configuration file or enter setup mode

#### Terminology
```
POST - Power-on self test to verify the basic operation of CPU, memory, and network interface port.

Bootstrap - A simple set of instructions that test hardware and initializes the IOS for operation

Load IOS - The boot field of configuration register determines the location that is used to load the IOS

Load configuration file
When the IOS is loaded, the configuration file saved in NVRAM will be loaded into main memory and execute one line at a time.

If there is no valid configuration file, the OS will search for the TFTP server.

If there is no TFTP server, the setup dialog(Setup mode) is initiated.
