#### ICMP
IP is a best effort delivery system. But it has no mechanism to check whether the data is delivered. Data may fail to reach its destination.

ICMP is used to help identify these failure. It will notify the sender if there is an error in the delivery process.

#### To test destination reachability
We can use ping command to test desination reachability. If the actual path includes too many hops. the packet will exceed the maximum hop count, resulting in unreachable destination.
