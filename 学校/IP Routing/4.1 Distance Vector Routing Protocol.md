#### Distance Vector Routing Updates
Routing table updates occur periodically or when the topology in a distance vector protocol network change.

Distance vetor algorithms call for each router to send its entire routing table to each neighboring router


#### RIP
Some Features:
1. It is a distance vector routing potocol
2. Hop count is used as the metric for path selection
3. if hop > 15, the packet will be discarded
4. routing updates are broadcast every 30 sec.
