4. JPEG 2000 differences

#### Calculation
| 表头 | 表头 |
| ---- | ---- |
| Frame size | 720\*480 pixels |
| Frame rate | 30 frame / sec |
| Bits per pixel | 24 |

Data rate: 30 \* (720 \* 480) \* 24 / 8 = 31,104,000 bytes / sec

#### Redundancy
1. Coding redundancy
2. Spatial and temporal redundancy
3. Irrelevant information

###### Coding redundancy
Unnecessarily assign a long code to a symbol, e.g. fixed-length coding

###### Spatial and temporal redundancy
Due to the spatial correlation between pixels of an image, e.g. A large area of one intensity.

Due to the temporal correlation between pixels of a video, e.g. Between two consecutive frames.

###### Irrelevant information
Information that is ignored by Human Visual System

#### DCT
It is often used for image data compression. By dividing the image into blocks of equal size (generally 8*8), DCT is used to transform them to obtain more concise data. Because there is a large spatial correlation between image pixels, DCT can greatly reduce these correlations, so that the image energy is concentrated in the upper-left area, which is conducive to data compression. The data obtained after transformation is called DCT coefficient. The process is lossless
