#### Spatial Filtering
The filtering is performed by shifing the mask over the whole image so that the center of the mask visits each pixel in the input image.

#### Border problem
When the mask center moves to the edge of the image, pixels may not be detected at the edge of the mask.

###### Solutions
1. change filter size along the border
2. enlarge the image(Fill with zeros, periodic extension of the image, mirroring the borders)

#### Linear & Non-linear spatial filtering
A filtering method is linear when the output is a weighted sum of the input pixels
