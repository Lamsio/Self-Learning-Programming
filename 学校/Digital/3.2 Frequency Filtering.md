高频令图像细节更清晰，低频令图像平滑
High frequency makes the image detail clearer, and low frequency makes the image smooth.

#### Blurring (Averaging / Lowpass)
Pixel averaging in the spatial domain: 
- Each pixel in the output is a weighted average of its neighbours. 
- Is a convolution whose weight matrix sums to 1.

Lowpass filtering in the frequency domain:
- High frequencies are diminished or eliminated.

The values of the output image are all non-negative.

#### Sharpening (Differencing / Highpass)

Pixel-differenced in the spatial domain:
- Each pixel in the output is a difference between itself and a weighted average of its neighbors.
- Is a convolution whose weight matrix sums to 0.

Highpass filtering in the frequency domain:
- High frequencies are enhanced or amplified.

The values of output image could be negative.

#### Ideal Filters
An ideal filter does not yield an ideal result.

Ringing will occur when converting from frequency domain to spatial domain, and the picture may be distorted.

#### Gaussian Filter
The Gaussian filter optimizes the uncertainty relation. It provides the sharpest cutoff possible without ringing.

σ Determines the smoothness of the image, the higher the value of σ, the smoother the image.
