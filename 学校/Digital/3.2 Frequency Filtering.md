4. Ideal


#### Blurring (Averaging / Lowpass)
Pixel averaging in the spatial domain: 
- Each pixel in the output is a weighted average of its neighbours. 
- Is a convolution whose weight matrix sums to 1.

Lowpass filtering in the frequency domain:
- High frequencies are diminished or eliminated.

The values of the output image are all non-negative.

#### Sharpening (Differencing / Highpass)
