#### Main points
1. Why?


#### Fourier Transform
A transform turns one function (or signal) in the time/space domain into its frequency form. (The decomposition of a nonperiodic signal into a continuous integral of sinusoids.)

###### The purpose of FT
Fourier transform is mainly to transform the signal in the time domain into the signal in the frequency domain, used for image noise reduction, image enhancement and other processing
