#### Main points
1. Why?


#### Fourier Transform
A transform turns one function (or signal) in the time/space domain into its frequency form. (The decomposition of a nonperiodic signal into a continuous integral of sinusoids.)

###### The purpose of FT
Fourier transform is mainly to transform the signal in the time domain into the signal in the frequency domain, used for image noise reduction, image enhancement and other processing.

Something in the time domain that's hard to deal with, in the frequency domain is easier to deal with

#### Phase
The phase information is crucial to reconstruct the correct image in spatial domain. It reveals almost the same information about the structure of spatial domain image as magnitude image.

#### Magnitude
The Magnitude image contain the components of all frequencies, each point indicate a frequency.
low frequency contains more information than high frequency.
