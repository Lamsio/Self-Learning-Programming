###### Main points - CC Analysis

#### Thresholding
###### What kinds of opeartions
1. Separate objects from the background and from one another.
2. Aggregate pixels for each object
3. compute features for each object.

###### Otsu's method
The thresholding which has the lowest sum of weighted variances or the threshold with the maximum between class variance.

#### Binary mathematical morphology
###### Dilation(膨胀)
Dilation expands the connected sets of 1s of a binary image.
Usages of Dilation:
1. growing features
2. filling holes and gaps

dilate(B,S) takes binary image B, places the origin of structuring element S over each 1-pixel, and ORs the structuring element S into the output image at the corresponding position.

######  Erosion(侵蚀)
Erosion shrinks the connected sets of 1s of a binary image.
Usages of Erosion:
1. shrinking features
2. removing bridges, branches and small protrusions

erode(B,S) takes a binary image B, places the origin of structuring element S over every pixel position, and ORs a binary 1 into that position of the output image only if every position of S (with a 1) covers a 1 in B.

###### Opening
Opening is the compound operation of Erosion followed by Dilation
Opening is less destructive to the shape of the foreground pixels than erosion.
