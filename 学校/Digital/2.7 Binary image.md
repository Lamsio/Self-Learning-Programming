###### Main points - CC Analysis

#### Thresholding
###### What kinds of opeartions
1. Separate objects from the background and from one another.
2. Aggregate pixels for each object
3. compute features for each object.

###### Otsu's method
The thresholding which has the lowest sum of weighted variances or the threshold with the maximum between class variance.

#### Binary mathematical morphology
###### Dilation(膨胀)
Dilation expands the connected sets of 1s of a binary image.
Usages of Dilation:
1. growing features
2. filling holes and gaps

######  Erosion(侵蚀)
Erosion shrinks the connected sets of 1s of a binary image.
Usages of Erosion:
1. shrinking features
2. removing bridges, branches and small protrusions
