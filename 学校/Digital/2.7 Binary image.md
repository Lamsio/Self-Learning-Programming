###### Main points - Morphology
1. Dilation & erosion
2. Opening & closing

###### Main points - CC Analysis

#### Thresholding
###### What kinds of opeartions
1. Separate objects from the background and from one another.
2. Aggregate pixels for each object
3. compute features for each object.

###### Otsu's method
The thresholding which has the lowest sum of weighted variances or the threshold with the maximum between class variance.

#### Binary mathematical morphology
###### Dilation(膨胀) and erosion(侵蚀)
