## Sampling & Quantization
Digitizing the coordinate values is called sampling.
Digitizing the amplitude values is quantization.
#### Sampling
- Spatial resolution
- Interpolation

Uniform: 图中每处的采样频率都是一样的
Adaptive: 优化，需要高频率的地方采用高频率，压缩策略

###### Zooming(up-sampling)
Objective: to increase the spatial resolution
It is also called **interpolation**

利用已知的像素点数据去预估别的像素点的值
Methods:
1. Nearest neighbour
2. bilinear
3. bicubic
###### Shrinking(sub-sampling)
4:1 subsampling means that only one out of every four pixels is used.


#### Quantization
Mapping continuous colors from black to white into discrete integers from 0 to 255.

###### Intensity resolution
The brightness of each pixel in the image is replaced by an integer value.
