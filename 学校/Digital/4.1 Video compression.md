#### Motion compensation(运动补偿)
Algorithms has three main steps:
1. Motion estimation
2. Motion compensation-based prediction
3. Derivation of the prediction error

###### Motion estimation
- Extracts motion info
- Search for motion vectors

###### Motion compensation-based prediction
Reconstruct a predicted frame using MBs from reference frame(s) and their motion vectors.

###### Derivation of the prediction error
Record the differences between predicted frame and real frame.

#### Summary
Each img is divided into macroblocks(MB) of size N\*N.

Luminace img:  N=16;
Chrominance img: N=8;

Current frame is refered to as **Target Frame**
Previous / Future Frame is refered to as **Reference Frame**

The displacement of the reference frame to target frame is called a motion vector

#### Sequential search
Calculate the MAD value of all pixels in the window and find out the position of the MAD minimum point as the motion vector.
