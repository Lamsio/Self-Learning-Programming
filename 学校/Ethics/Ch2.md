#### Workable ethical theory
produces explanations that might be persuasive to a skeptical, yet open-minded audience

#### Relativism
- No universal norms of right and wrong.
- One person can say “X is right,” another can say “X is wrong,” and both can be right.

#### Subjective relativism
- Each person decides right and wrong for himself or herself 
- “What’s right for you may not be right for me

###### Case Against Subjective Relativism
1. Decisions may not be based on reason.
2. Blurs distinction between doing what you think is right and doing what you want to do
3. SR and tolerance are two different things

#### Cultural Relativism
- What is “right” and “wrong” depends upon a society’s actual moral guidelines 
- These guidelines vary from place to place and from time to time

E.g: Smoking marijuana is legal in Canada, but illegal in China

###### Case Against Cultural Relativism
1. It doesn’t explain how moral guidelines are determined
2. Only indirectly based on reason
3. The conflict cannot be resolved

#### Divine Command Theory
Good actions: those aligned with God’s will
Bad actions: those contrary to God’s will
Holy books reveal God’s will
We should use holy books as moral decision-making guides

###### Case Against Divine Command Theory
1. Different holy books disagree
2. There is no way to prove god is good
3. Some modern problem can not be solved

#### Ethical Egoism
Each person should focus exclusively on his or her self-interest
Morally right action: that action that provides self with maximum long-term benefit

###### Case Against Ethical Egoism
1. An easy moral philosophy may not be the best moral philosophy
2. Self-interest can lead to blatantly immoral behavior
3. By definition, does not respect the ethical point of view

#### Kantianism
Good will: to desire to do the right things

###### 1st Formulation
Act only from moral rules that you can at the same time will to be universal moral laws.

###### 2nd Formulation
Act so that you treat both yourself and other people as ends in themselves and never only as a means to an end

###### Case for Kantianism
- Rational
- Produces universal moral guidelines
- Treats all people as moral equals

###### Case against Kantianism
- Sometimes no rule adequately characterizes an action
- Kantianism allows no exceptions to perfect duties

#### Principle of utility
An action is good if benefits someone, otherwise it is bad.

An action is right(or wrong) if it increases(or decrease) someone's happiness.

#### Act Utilitarianism
Utilitarianism: Focus on consequences

- Add up change in happiness of all affected things
- sum>0, the action is good
- sum<0, the action is wrong

#### Rule Utilitarianism
- Act utilitarianism applies Principle of Utility to individual actions
- Rule utilitarianism applies Principle of Utility to moral rules

###### Case against Utilitarianism
1. All consequences must be measured on a single scale
2. ignores the problem of an unjust distribution of good consequences

#### Social Contract Theory

###### Kinds of rights
1. Negative rights: A right that another can guarantee by leaving you alone.
2. Positive rights: A right to ask somebody to do something for you
3. Absolute rights: A right guaranteed without exception
4. Limited rights: A right that may be limited based on the circumstances

Positive right tend to be more limited, whereas negative rights tend to be more absoluted.
